/**
 * Your homework:
 *
 * - Write a new calendar program: one that prints out 12 monthly calendars
 *   (one per month)
 * - Ensure correct number of days on each month (assume 28 days in February)
 * - Above each calendar print out the month name (not number!)
 * - For now assume all months start on Sunday
 * - The first row on each calendar must contain day titles (each weekday is
 *   a column)
 * - Day cells must contain the day number (1 â€“ 31)
 * - Assume a global array named $holidays is provided (see example below),
 *   containing holidays by month number (1..12) and day number (1..31)
 * - Make sure holidays have a special colored background, and that the holiday
 *   name appears on the table cell
 * - Define and use at least two functions
 * - Separate functions into a separate file included from the main file
 *   generating the HTML
 * - You should be able to perform this task by looking at the previous week's
 *   homework and using the material covered today in class.
